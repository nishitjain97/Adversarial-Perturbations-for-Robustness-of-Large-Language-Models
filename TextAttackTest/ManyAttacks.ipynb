    "An attack in TextAttack consists of four parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goal function\n",
    "\n",
    "The **goal function** determines if the attack is successful or not. One common goal function is **untargeted classification**, where the attack tries to perturb an input to change its classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Search method\n",
    "The **search method** explores the space of potential transformations and tries to locate a successful perturbation. Greedy search, beam search, and brute-force search are all examples of search methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transformation\n",
    "A **transformation** takes a text input and transforms it, for example replacing words or phrases with similar ones, while trying not to change the meaning. Paraphrase and synonym substitution are two broad classes of transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "Finally, **constraints** determine whether or not a given transformation is valid. Transformations don't perfectly preserve syntax or semantics, so additional constraints can increase the probability that these qualities are preserved from the source to adversarial example. There are many types of constraints: overlap constraints that measure edit distance, syntactical  constraints check part-of-speech and grammar errors, and semantic constraints like language models and sentence encoders."

    "### A custom transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson explains how to create a custom transformation. In TextAttack, many transformations involve *word swaps*: they take a word and try and find suitable substitutes. Some attacks focus on replacing characters with neighboring characters to create \"typos\" (these don't intend to preserve the grammaticality of inputs). Other attacks rely on semantics: they take a word and try to replace it with semantic equivalents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Banana word swap \n",
    "\n",
    "As an introduction to writing transformations for TextAttack, we're going to try a very simple transformation: one that replaces any given word with the word 'banana'. In TextAttack, there's an abstract `WordSwap` class that handles the heavy lifting of breaking sentences into words and avoiding replacement of stopwords. We can extend `WordSwap` and implement a single method, `_get_replacement_words`, to indicate to replace each word with 'banana'. üçå"

Unfortunately, they also teamed up with the music industry (EMI, and various artists) to make this popular. EMI has apparently negotiated their end well, so that children in our schools will now be indoctrinated about the illegality of downloading music.The ignorance and audacity of this got to me a little, so I wrote an open letter to the DfES about it. Unfortunately, it's pedantic, as I suppose you have to be when writing to goverment representatives.

As we discussed last week   Trump ‚Äô s position on this has evolved . Asked at a press conference at Camp David whether he ‚Äô s still committed to speaking with Mueller   Trump hedged   refusing to answer the question directly . A few days later   at an event alongside the prime minister of Norway   Trump faced a similar question . The Republican ‚Äô s response was long   meandering   and not altogether coherent   but he concluded that it ‚Äú seems unlikely ‚Äù that he ‚Äô d answer the special counsel ‚Äô s questions . Close video Trump lawyers change defense on collusion and obstruction Rachel Maddow points out that  Donald Trump ‚Äô s lawyers ‚Äô arguments about Trump ‚Äô s legal liability in the Russia scandal  have changed from denying Trump ‚Äô s actions to excusing  them  as not illegal . Also noted is that Mike Pence ‚Äô s lies about Mike Flynn need a new share tweet email save Embed Special counsel Robert S . Mueller III is seeking to question President Trump in the coming weeks about his decisions to oust national security adviser Michael Flynn and FBI Director James B . Comey   according to two people familiar with his plans . Mueller ‚Äô s interest in the events that led Trump to push out Flynn and Comey indicates that his investigation is intensifying its focus on possible efforts by the president or others to obstruct or blunt the special counsel ‚Äô s probe . If today ‚Äô s reporting from the Washington Post is any indication    Trump  may need to change  his  posture once more . This dovetails with a story that ‚Äô s been brewing of late . NBC News reported two weeks ago   for example   that the logistics and scope of an interview between the special counsel ‚Äô s team and  Trump  were the subject of discussion among the relevant lawyers . Bloomberg Politics reported soon after that talks between Trump ‚Äô s legal team and Mueller ‚Äô s team are ‚Äú expected to continue ‚Ä¶ despite comments from  Trump  suggesting an interview is unlikely .‚Äù With this in mind   the Post added that the president ‚Äô s attorneys ‚Äú have crafted some negotiating terms for the president ‚Äô s interview with Mueller ‚Äô s team   one that could be presented to the special counsel as soon as next week   according to the two people .‚Äù As for the nature of the conversation   the Post ‚Äô s article went on to say that Trump   under the current plan   would like to answer some questions in an in - person interview   while answering others in writing   which is also consistent with NBC News ‚Äô recent reporting . ( Why the president would find it necessary to turn part of the Q & A into a take - home exam is unclear .) It ‚Äô s the subject of interest   however   that continues to stand out : if the special counsel is focused specifically on possible obstruction of justice   it suggests the president may be facing legal jeopardy . In November   Trump said   ‚Äú As far as I ‚Äô m concerned   I haven ‚Äô t been told that we ‚Äô re under investigation   I ‚Äô m not under investigation .‚Äù It may be a good idea to revisit that .')]), 1)]\n"

Some Republicans have argued a shutdown would hurt military readiness by disrupting supply chains and complicating planning and contracts .\n",

      "Trump   Xi present united front despite differences BEIJING ‚Äî  President Donald Trump  sought to present a united front with Chinese President Xi Jinping following two days of meetings Thursday   despite lingering differences over trade and North Korea . On trade    Trump  criticized the ‚Äú very one - sided and unfair ‚Äù trade relationship between the U . S . and China but stopped short of castigating Xi by saying he doesn ‚Äô t blame the country for having taken advantage of the U . S .  Trump  said China ‚Äú must immediately address the unfair trade practices that drive ‚Äù what  he  said is a ‚Äú shockingly ‚Äù large trade deficit   along with barriers to market access   forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft . ‚Äú But I don ‚Äô t blame China  ‚Äù  he  said . ‚Äú After all   who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens ?‚Äù To applause    Trump  said : ‚Äú I give China great credit .‚Äù  His  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered a blunter assessment of China ‚Äô s trade surplus with the United States   which in October widened by 12 . 2 percent from a year earlier   to $ 26 . 6 billion . The total surplus with the United States for the first 10 months of the year was $ 223 billion . ___  Trump  cooperates with Chinese effort to control image BEIJING ‚Äî U . S .  President Donald Trump  was a cooperative partner for Beijing ‚Äô s sweeping efforts to control the message of  his  heavily choreographed visit to China . Trump and  his  Chinese counterpart   Xi Jinping   took no questions at an event Thursday billed as a news briefing   a reduction of already minimal press interaction during previous visits by American leaders . During a 2014 visit by then President Barack Obama   Xi took a symbolic single question from a reporter for a Chinese state newspaper . He brushed off an American reporter ‚Äô s question about whether Beijing might ease restrictions on journalist visas   saying vaguely that media outlets had to obey China ‚Äô s laws . Trump   who has called the media the ‚Äú enemy of the American people  ‚Äù also took no questions during an event at which Chinese companies signed contracts to buy American jetliners   soybeans and other goods . Trump ‚Äô s visit comes at a time when he faces uncomfortable questions at home about Russia and possible gun controls following deadly mass shootings . ___ North Korea   ever so cautiously   is going online PYONGYANG   North Korea ‚Äî Ever so cautiously   North Korea is going online . Doctors can consult via live   online video conferencing   and lectures at prestigious Kim Il Sung University are streamed to faraway factories and agricultural communes . People use online dictionaries and text each other on their smart phones . In the wallets of the privileged are ‚Äú Jonsong ‚Äù or ‚Äú Narae ‚Äù cards for e - shopping and online banking . Cash registers at major department stores are plugged into the web . It ‚Äô s just not the World Wide Web . This is all done on a tightly sealed intranet of the sort a medium - sized company might use for its employees . The free flow of information is anathema to authoritarian regimes   and with the possible exception of the African dictatorship of Eritrea   North Korea is still the least Internet - friendly country on Earth . Access to the global Internet for most is unimaginable . Hardly anyone has a personal computer or an email address that isn ‚Äô t shared   and the price for trying to get around the government ‚Äô s rules can be severe . But for Kim Jong Un   the country ‚Äô s first leader to come of age with the Internet   the idea of a more wired North Korea is also attractive . It comes with the potential for great benefits to the nation from information technology ‚Äî and for new forms of social and political control that promise to be more effective than anything his father and grandfather could have dreamed of . It also allows for the possibility of cyber - attacks on the West . ___ Pence   Abbott attend vigil for victims of church shooting SUTHERLAND SPRINGS   Texas ‚Äî Vice President Mike Pence joined Texas Gov . Greg Abbott at a memorial service for the victims of Sunday ‚Äô s massacre at a small - town Texas church . Pence told the crowd Wednesday evening that the shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs was the worst mass shooting at a church in American history and called the gunman ‚Äú deranged .‚Äù ‚Äú Whatever animated the evil that descended on that small church   of the attacker ‚Äô s desire was to silence their testimony of faith   they failed  ‚Äù the vice president added . Abbott began the service by praying ‚Äú for healing and for help .‚Äù The governor said that Texans come together at times of crisis and tragedy . ‚Äú It ‚Äô s what we do  ‚Äù Abbott said . People in the crowd responded ‚Äú amen .‚Äù ___ Las Vegas shooting victims still searching for their heroes LOS ANGELES ‚Äî As soon as Chris Gilman knew she would survive the gunshot wound she sustained in the Las Vegas massacre   she wanted to find the two strangers who saved her life ‚Äî a man and woman whose names she didn ‚Äô t even know . She found a Facebook page called ‚Äú Find My LV Hero ‚Äù and posted a plea . ‚Äú Looking for husband and wife who were by the VIP bleachers and helped me get out  ‚Äù wrote Gilman   of Bonney Lake   Washington . ‚Äú My wife gave the husband her shirt and the wife held it against my side to stop bleeding as they carried me through the VIP area out to the street .‚Äù Despite the scant details in Gilman ‚Äô s post   it worked . Three days later   Gilman connected with her rescuers   Alex and Wanda Valiente   off - duty Los Angeles County sheriff ‚Äô s deputies who were at the Oct . 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of a hotel   killing 58 people and wounding hundreds . The connection is one of about 25 made so far through the Facebook page . Nearly six weeks after the massacre   Ashton Zyer ‚Äô s social media creation continues to generate new searches for heroes who in some cases saved lives and in others simply provided what comfort they could . ___ IS militants evacuate last stronghold in Syria to government BEIRUT ‚Äî A Syrian war monitor says Islamic State militants have withdrawn from their last stronghold following a government offensive . The Britain - based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says government forces and allied troops   including Iraqi fighters   are combing Boukamal   a strategic town on the border with Iraq   on Thursday after IS militants withdrew . Syrian pro - government media say Syrian troops had clashed with remnants of IS militants in the town after they entered it late Wednesday . On Thursday   they declared the town totally free of the militants . The fall of Boukamal means remaining IS militants are currently holed up in small towns and villages along the border with Iraq and in the Syrian desert . ___ Democrats see wins as momentum for 2018 state elections Sweeping Democratic victories in Virginia and key gains in other 2017 state legislative races have lifted Democratic hopes of even bigger wins in next year ‚Äô s midterm elections   as they seek a greater voice in how political districts will be redrawn for the decade to come . Democrats won the governors ‚Äô offices in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday   erased a previously dominant Republican majority in the Virginia House of Delegates and won a special election that gave them control of the Washington state Senate . All told   Democrats flipped about two dozen state legislative seats around the country Tuesday and have now gained at least 30 seats previously held by Republicans since  President Donald Trump  won election last year   reversing several years of Republican momentum . ‚Äú In general   this is a rebuke of Republican governance of states  ‚Äù said Jessica Post   executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee . She added : ‚Äú The other thing it said is we can win all across the country .‚Äù The fight for control of legislative chambers matters not only for policies on health care   taxes and education   but also because the legislature in most states determines how future congressional and state legislative districts are drawn . The next round of redistricting will take place after the 2020 Census   and both parties are focused on controlling as many states as possible by then . ___ Pomp and flattery : Asia rolls out the red carpets for Trump BEIJING ‚Äî Honor guards marching in unison in colorful uniforms . Elaborate state dinners with celebrity guests . Gaggles of children   jumping and screaming along with endless praise . The first half of President Donald Trump ‚Äô s whirlwind tour to Asia has been an exercise in the art of flattery   as world leaders woo the man who was introduced at the South Korean National Assembly as the ‚Äú leader of the world .‚Äù ‚Äú They are not ignorant that this is a president who is particularly responsive to flattery  ‚Äù said Lindsey Ford of the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington   who said the Chinese   in particular   would ‚Äú absolutely go over the top ‚Äù trying to stroke the president ‚Äô s ego . The pomp and pageantry began in Japan   where  Trump  was welcomed to the grand Akasaka Palace with a welcome ceremony that featured a maze of red carpets   an honor guard and marching band . Prime Minister Shinzo Abe   who has gone out of his way to strike up a personal friendship with  Trump    also treated the president to a round of golf at Japan ‚Äô s premier course   complete with a champion golf partner and a taste of home : a hamburger lunch made with American beef . ___ Christopher Plummer to replace Kevin Spacey in Getty film LOS ANGELES ‚Äî In a wholly unprecedented move   Kevin Spacey is being cut from Ridley Scott ‚Äô s finished film ‚Äú All the Money in the World ‚Äù and replaced by Christopher Plummer just over one month before it ‚Äô s supposed to hit theaters . People close to the production who were not authorized to speak publicly said Wednesday that Plummer is commencing reshoots immediately in the role of J . Paul Getty . All of Spacey ‚Äô s scenes will be reshot   the people told The Associated Press . Co - stars Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams are expected to participate . Scott   who is known to be an efficient director   is intending to keep the film ‚Äô s Dec . 22 release date . The director ‚Äô s publicist Simon Halls confirmed the switch late Wednesday . The film was originally set to have its world premiere at the AFI Fest in Los Angeles on Nov . 16 but was pulled earlier this week amid the sexual harassment reports surrounding Spacey   who has also been fired from ‚Äú House of Cards ‚Äù and dropped by his talent agency and publicist . ___ Top moments at CMA Awards : Vegas   unity and the monologue Yes   Garth Brooks won entertainer of the year and Chris Stapleton picked up two honors   including album of the year . But the moments that truly dominated the 2017 Country Music Association Awards had less to do with winning   and more about a community banding together to heal . Here ‚Äô s a look at some of the top moments at the awards show   which aired live Wednesday night from the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville   Tennessee . ______ HONORING THE LAS VEGAS VICTIMS The Associated Press .\n",

The White House later said  the president  fully backed the proposal pending in the House of Representatives   which includes the insurance plan .

      "At a press conference in June   a reporter asked  Donald Trump  whether  he  ‚Äô d be willing to answer questions about the Russia scandal under oath . ‚Äú One hundred percent  ‚Äù the president responded . As we discussed last week   Trump ‚Äô s position on this has evolved . Asked at a press conference at Camp David whether he ‚Äô s still committed to speaking with Mueller   Trump hedged   refusing to answer the question directly . A few days later   at an event alongside the prime minister of Norway   Trump faced a similar question . The Republican ‚Äô s response was long   meandering   and not altogether coherent   but he concluded that it ‚Äú seems unlikely ‚Äù that he ‚Äô d answer the special counsel ‚Äô s questions . Close video Trump lawyers change defense on collusion and obstruction Rachel Maddow points out that  Donald Trump ‚Äô s lawyers ‚Äô arguments about Trump ‚Äô s legal liability in the Russia scandal  have changed from denying Trump ‚Äô s actions to excusing  them  as not illegal . Also noted is that Mike Pence ‚Äô s lies about Mike Flynn need a new share tweet email save Embed Special counsel Robert S . Mueller III is seeking to question President Trump in the coming weeks about his decisions to oust national security adviser Michael Flynn and FBI Director James B . Comey   according to two people familiar with his plans . Mueller ‚Äô s interest in the events that led Trump to push out Flynn and Comey indicates that his investigation is intensifying its focus on possible efforts by the president or others to obstruct or blunt the special counsel ‚Äô s probe . If today ‚Äô s reporting from the Washington Post is any indication    Trump  may need to change  his  posture once more . This dovetails with a story that ‚Äô s been brewing of late . NBC News reported two weeks ago   for example   that the logistics and scope of an interview between the special counsel ‚Äô s team and  Trump  were the subject of discussion among the relevant lawyers . Bloomberg Politics reported soon after that talks between Trump ‚Äô s legal team and Mueller ‚Äô s team are ‚Äú expected to continue ‚Ä¶ despite comments from  Trump  suggesting an interview is unlikely .‚Äù With this in mind   the Post added that the president ‚Äô s attorneys ‚Äú have crafted some negotiating terms for the president ‚Äô s interview with Mueller ‚Äô s team   one that could be presented to the special counsel as soon as next week   according to the two people .‚Äù As for the nature of the conversation   the Post ‚Äô s article went on to say that Trump   under the current plan   would like to answer some questions in an in - person interview   while answering others in writing   which is also consistent with NBC News ‚Äô recent reporting . ( Why the president would find it necessary to turn part of the Q & A into a take - home exam is unclear .) It ‚Äô s the subject of interest   however   that continues to stand out : if the special counsel is focused specifically on possible obstruction of justice   it suggests the president may be facing legal jeopardy . In November   Trump said   ‚Äú As far as I ‚Äô m concerned   I haven ‚Äô t been told that we ‚Äô re under investigation   I ‚Äô m not under investigation .‚Äù It may be a good idea to revisit that .\n",

      "Trump   Xi present united front despite differences BEIJING ‚Äî  President Donald Trump  sought to present a united front with Chinese President Xi Jinping following two days of meetings Thursday   despite lingering differences over trade and North Korea . On trade    Trump  criticized the ‚Äú very one - sided and unfair ‚Äù trade relationship between the U . S . and China but stopped short of castigating Xi by saying he doesn ‚Äô t blame the country for having taken advantage of the U . S .  Trump  said China ‚Äú must immediately address the unfair trade practices that drive ‚Äù what  he  said is a ‚Äú shockingly ‚Äù large trade deficit   along with barriers to market access   forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft . ‚Äú But I don ‚Äô t blame China  ‚Äù  he  said . ‚Äú After all   who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens ?‚Äù To applause    Trump  said : ‚Äú I give China great credit .‚Äù  His  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered a blunter assessment of China ‚Äô s trade surplus with the United States   which in October widened by 12 . 2 percent from a year earlier   to $ 26 . 6 billion . The total surplus with the United States for the first 10 months of the year was $ 223 billion . ___  Trump  cooperates with Chinese effort to control image BEIJING ‚Äî U . S .  President Donald Trump  was a cooperative partner for Beijing ‚Äô s sweeping efforts to control the message of  his  heavily choreographed visit to China . Trump and  his  Chinese counterpart   Xi Jinping   took no questions at an event Thursday billed as a news briefing   a reduction of already minimal press interaction during previous visits by American leaders . During a 2014 visit by then President Barack Obama   Xi took a symbolic single question from a reporter for a Chinese state newspaper . He brushed off an American reporter ‚Äô s question about whether Beijing might ease restrictions on journalist visas   saying vaguely that media outlets had to obey China ‚Äô s laws . Trump   who has called the media the ‚Äú enemy of the American people  ‚Äù also took no questions during an event at which Chinese companies signed contracts to buy American jetliners   soybeans and other goods . Trump ‚Äô s visit comes at a time when he faces uncomfortable questions at home about Russia and possible gun controls following deadly mass shootings . ___ North Korea   ever so cautiously   is going online PYONGYANG   North Korea ‚Äî Ever so cautiously   North Korea is going online . Doctors can consult via live   online video conferencing   and lectures at prestigious Kim Il Sung University are streamed to faraway factories and agricultural communes . People use online dictionaries and text each other on their smart phones . In the wallets of the privileged are ‚Äú Jonsong ‚Äù or ‚Äú Narae ‚Äù cards for e - shopping and online banking . Cash registers at major department stores are plugged into the web . It ‚Äô s just not the World Wide Web . This is all done on a tightly sealed intranet of the sort a medium - sized company might use for its employees . The free flow of information is anathema to authoritarian regimes   and with the possible exception of the African dictatorship of Eritrea   North Korea is still the least Internet - friendly country on Earth . Access to the global Internet for most is unimaginable . Hardly anyone has a personal computer or an email address that isn ‚Äô t shared   and the price for trying to get around the government ‚Äô s rules can be severe . But for Kim Jong Un   the country ‚Äô s first leader to come of age with the Internet   the idea of a more wired North Korea is also attractive . It comes with the potential for great benefits to the nation from information technology ‚Äî and for new forms of social and political control that promise to be more effective than anything his father and grandfather could have dreamed of . It also allows for the possibility of cyber - attacks on the West . ___ Pence   Abbott attend vigil for victims of church shooting SUTHERLAND SPRINGS   Texas ‚Äî Vice President Mike Pence joined Texas Gov . Greg Abbott at a memorial service for the victims of Sunday ‚Äô s massacre at a small - town Texas church . Pence told the crowd Wednesday evening that the shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs was the worst mass shooting at a church in American history and called the gunman ‚Äú deranged .‚Äù ‚Äú Whatever animated the evil that descended on that small church   of the attacker ‚Äô s desire was to silence their testimony of faith   they failed  ‚Äù the vice president added . Abbott began the service by praying ‚Äú for healing and for help .‚Äù The governor said that Texans come together at times of crisis and tragedy . ‚Äú It ‚Äô s what we do  ‚Äù Abbott said . People in the crowd responded ‚Äú amen .‚Äù ___ Las Vegas shooting victims still searching for their heroes LOS ANGELES ‚Äî As soon as Chris Gilman knew she would survive the gunshot wound she sustained in the Las Vegas massacre   she wanted to find the two strangers who saved her life ‚Äî a man and woman whose names she didn ‚Äô t even know . She found a Facebook page called ‚Äú Find My LV Hero ‚Äù and posted a plea . ‚Äú Looking for husband and wife who were by the VIP bleachers and helped me get out  ‚Äù wrote Gilman   of Bonney Lake   Washington . ‚Äú My wife gave the husband her shirt and the wife held it against my side to stop bleeding as they carried me through the VIP area out to the street .‚Äù Despite the scant details in Gilman ‚Äô s post   it worked . Three days later   Gilman connected with her rescuers   Alex and Wanda Valiente   off - duty Los Angeles County sheriff ‚Äô s deputies who were at the Oct . 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of a hotel   killing 58 people and wounding hundreds . The connection is one of about 25 made so far through the Facebook page . Nearly six weeks after the massacre   Ashton Zyer ‚Äô s social media creation continues to generate new searches for heroes who in some cases saved lives and in others simply provided what comfort they could . ___ IS militants evacuate last stronghold in Syria to government BEIRUT ‚Äî A Syrian war monitor says Islamic State militants have withdrawn from their last stronghold following a government offensive . The Britain - based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says government forces and allied troops   including Iraqi fighters   are combing Boukamal   a strategic town on the border with Iraq   on Thursday after IS militants withdrew . Syrian pro - government media say Syrian troops had clashed with remnants of IS militants in the town after they entered it late Wednesday . On Thursday   they declared the town totally free of the militants . The fall of Boukamal means remaining IS militants are currently holed up in small towns and villages along the border with Iraq and in the Syrian desert . ___ Democrats see wins as momentum for 2018 state elections Sweeping Democratic victories in Virginia and key gains in other 2017 state legislative races have lifted Democratic hopes of even bigger wins in next year ‚Äô s midterm elections   as they seek a greater voice in how political districts will be redrawn for the decade to come . Democrats won the governors ‚Äô offices in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday   erased a previously dominant Republican majority in the Virginia House of Delegates and won a special election that gave them control of the Washington state Senate . All told   Democrats flipped about two dozen state legislative seats around the country Tuesday and have now gained at least 30 seats previously held by Republicans since  President Donald Trump  won election last year   reversing several years of Republican momentum . ‚Äú In general   this is a rebuke of Republican governance of states  ‚Äù said Jessica Post   executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee . She added : ‚Äú The other thing it said is we can win all across the country .‚Äù The fight for control of legislative chambers matters not only for policies on health care   taxes and education   but also because the legislature in most states determines how future congressional and state legislative districts are drawn . The next round of redistricting will take place after the 2020 Census   and both parties are focused on controlling as many states as possible by then . ___ Pomp and flattery : Asia rolls out the red carpets for Trump BEIJING ‚Äî Honor guards marching in unison in colorful uniforms . Elaborate state dinners with celebrity guests . Gaggles of children   jumping and screaming along with endless praise . The first half of President Donald Trump ‚Äô s whirlwind tour to Asia has been an exercise in the art of flattery   as world leaders woo the man who was introduced at the South Korean National Assembly as the ‚Äú leader of the world .‚Äù ‚Äú They are not ignorant that this is a president who is particularly responsive to flattery  ‚Äù said Lindsey Ford of the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington   who said the Chinese   in particular   would ‚Äú absolutely go over the top ‚Äù trying to stroke the president ‚Äô s ego . The pomp and pageantry began in Japan   where  Trump  was welcomed to the grand Akasaka Palace with a welcome ceremony that featured a maze of red carpets   an honor guard and marching band . Prime Minister Shinzo Abe   who has gone out of his way to strike up a personal friendship with  Trump    also treated the president to a round of golf at Japan ‚Äô s premier course   complete with a champion golf partner and a taste of home : a hamburger lunch made with American beef . ___ Christopher Plummer to replace Kevin Spacey in Getty film LOS ANGELES ‚Äî In a wholly unprecedented move   Kevin Spacey is being cut from Ridley Scott ‚Äô s finished film ‚Äú All the Money in the World ‚Äù and replaced by Christopher Plummer just over one month before it ‚Äô s supposed to hit theaters . People close to the production who were not authorized to speak publicly said Wednesday that Plummer is commencing reshoots immediately in the role of J . Paul Getty . All of Spacey ‚Äô s scenes will be reshot   the people told The Associated Press . Co - stars Mark Wahlberg and Michelle Williams are expected to participate . Scott   who is known to be an efficient director   is intending to keep the film ‚Äô s Dec . 22 release date . The director ‚Äô s publicist Simon Halls confirmed the switch late Wednesday . The film was originally set to have its world premiere at the AFI Fest in Los Angeles on Nov . 16 but was pulled earlier this week amid the sexual harassment reports surrounding Spacey   who has also been fired from ‚Äú House of Cards ‚Äù and dropped by his talent agency and publicist . ___ Top moments at CMA Awards : Vegas   unity and the monologue Yes   Garth Brooks won entertainer of the year and Chris Stapleton picked up two honors   including album of the year . But the moments that truly dominated the 2017 Country Music Association Awards had less to do with winning   and more about a community banding together to heal . Here ‚Äô s a look at some of the top moments at the awards show   which aired live Wednesday night from the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville   Tennessee . ______ HONORING THE LAS VEGAS VICTIMS The Associated Press .\n",

      "The Latest on President Donald Trump in Florida ( all times local ): 9 : 35 p . m .  President Donald Trump  says  he  believes special counsel Robert Mueller \" will be fair \" to him   because \" everybody knows that there was no collusion \" between  Trump  ' s presidential campaign and Russia . Mueller is leading the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election . Trump tells The New York Times in an interview posted Thursday night that Mueller ' s probe ‚Äî as well as two congressional investigations into the matter ‚Äî have \" angered \" his base and \" made the base stronger .\" He says some lawmakers \" have been unbelievable in pointing out what a witch hunt the whole thing is .\" And  the president  repeats his assertion that Democrats \" made the Russian story up as a hoax   as a ruse   as an excuse for losing an election that in theory Democrats should always win .\" ‚Äî‚Äî 7 : 20 p . m .  President Donald Trump  says the East Coast \" could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming \" as bitter cold temperatures are expected to freeze large swaths of the country this holiday weekend .

Trump  has repeatedly expressed skepticism about climate change science   calling global warming a \" hoax \" created by the Chinese to damage American industry .  He  announced earlier this year  his  intention to pull out of the landmark Paris climate agreement aimed at curbing greenhouse gas production . ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 7 p . m .

      "[[Republicans]] in Congress are nowhere near [[coming]] together around any [[plan]] to address gun violence   nearly two weeks after a school shooting in Florida left 17 dead   and despite President Donald Trump ‚Äô s promises to take action . Returning to Washington [[Monday]] after a [[week]] on recess   [[Republicans]] were [[divided]] on a slew of proposals the president has raised   and some questioned whether any [[reforms]] are [[needed]] at all . ‚Äú I don ‚Äô t [[think]] we need more gun control  ‚Äù Louisiana Sen . [[John]] Kennedy told reporters Monday . ‚Äú I think we [[need]] better idiot control .‚Äù Trump   who has been talking to [[congressional]] Republicans and lobbyists from the [[National]] [[Rifle]] Association in [[recent]] [[days]]   has [[proposed]] a [[broad]] range of ideas during listening [[sessions]] and in tweets   [[including]] [[increasing]] the [[age]] [[requirement]] for [[purchasing]] [[certain]] [[types]] of [[guns]]   [[arming]] some teachers   [[making]] [[changes]] to the background check system   reopening mental institutions   and banning bump stocks through the Department of [[Justice]] . The [[White]] [[House]] is [[scheduled]] to [[host]] a bipartisan [[group]] of [[lawmakers]] Wednesday to [[come]] up with a path [[forward]] on some of those [[ideas]] . ‚Äú [[We]] continue to [[mourn]] the [[loss]] of [[so]] many precious [[young]] [[lives]]  ‚Äù Trump said [[Monday]] . ‚Äú These are incredible people .

In a [[room]] with [[several]] [[Republican]] governors    Trump  said [[Monday]] not to [[worry]] about the [[influential]] [[group]] . \" You guys ‚Äî half of you are so afraid of the NRA  ‚Äù  he  said . ‚Äú There ' s nothing to be afraid of .

Mario D√≠az - Balart also took a more open position . ‚Äú I ' m willing to look at anything to keep the American people safe   but I also need to make sure that we protect individual liberties  \" he told reporters Monday . Rep . Mark Meadows   chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus   said his group plans to discuss various gun control measures   but some   such as raising the legal age of purchasing some firearms   will not be supported by the majority of the Republican party . Another measure being discussed is the so - called Fix NICS bill   which would strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System . That measure was passed by the House in December   but only after being tied to rules that would allow anyone with a concealed - carry permit to carry concealed weapons across state lines . That made the bill a nonstarter in the Senate . Meadows said at the time Speaker Paul Ryan told the Freedom Caucus there would be no other votes on Fix NICS . Now it is being floated again   but Meadows says the Freedom Caucus has objections over due process fears . Meadows said the legislation as written would allow for guns to be taken away from people who do not have proper channels to defend their mental state . The  Trump  administration   for all of the president ‚Äô s calls to action   has not moved to rally Republicans around any specific proposals   and is yet to provide any language on exactly what they would like Congress to support .  Trump  has said several times  he  ‚Äô d like to strengthen background checks   but the president and  his  aides have declined to say if they support universal background checks   which failed to garner enough votes in Congress in the wake of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting . And on raising the age requirements   a measure that the NRA does not support   White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday   ‚Äú it would be premature for us to weigh in .

      "The U . S . Senate on Wednesday took a step toward passage of tax legislation that is a top White House priority   setting up a likely decisive vote later this week even though it was unclear if the bill has enough Republican support to become law . Congressional Republicans spent the day scrambling to reformulate their tax bill to satisfy lawmakers worried about how much it would balloon the U . S . budget deficit . On a Christmas themed stage   U . S . President Donald Trump speaks about tax reform legislation in St . Louis   Missouri   U . S . November 29   2017 . REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque Stocks rallied on optimism the tax overhaul package could pass   but obstacles remained   including attempts to address the estimated $ 1 . 4 trillion that the bill would add to the United States ‚Äô $ 20 trillion national debt over 10 years . Lawmakers voted by a 52 - 48 margin to begin formal debate   a step that could lead on Thursday and Friday to a decisive vote on the bill   which aims to cut taxes on corporations   other businesses and a wide range of individuals and families . Republicans have a 52 - 48 majority in the 100 - member Senate   giving them enough votes to approve the bill if they can hold together . Without Democratic support   Republicans can afford to lose no more than two of their own votes . U . S . President Donald Trump speaks about tax reform legislation during a visit to St . Louis   Missouri   U . S . November 29   2017 . REUTERS /  Kevin Lamarque President Donald Trump in a speech in Missouri on Wednesday    implored members of  his  own party to get behind the effort   which would be  his  first significant legislative achievement since taking office in January . ‚Äú A vote to cut taxes is a vote to put America first again  ‚Äù Trump said   adding the bill could ‚Äú cost me a fortune ‚Äù and that his wealthy friends were not happy . ‚Äú My accountants are going crazy right now . It ‚Äô s all right . Hey look   I am president   I don ‚Äô t care . I don ‚Äô t care anymore .‚Äù Slideshow ( 3 Images ) Democrats say the tax cuts are a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy at the expense of working Americans . Some Democrats have said  Trump  and  his  children would gain from the bill   which would repeal the estate tax on inherited wealth . Among Americans aware of the Republican tax plan   49 percent said they were opposed   up from 41 percent in October   according to a Nov . 23 - 27 Reuters / Ipsos poll released on Wednesday . The latest online poll of 1   257 adults found 29 percent supporting the plan and 22 percent saying they ‚Äú don ‚Äô t know .‚Äù The sweeping tax package was developed over several months behind closed doors by a small group of senior congressional and Trump administration figures   with little input from many Republican lawmakers and no involvement from Democrats .\n",

      "When it comes to  the Russia scandal   Donald Trump and his team  have adopted a series of evolving postures . Remember when  they  used to argue ‚Äì with a straight face ‚Äì that literally no one from Trump ‚Äô s operation was in communications with Russians during the foreign attack on the American elections ? As it turns out   Trump World doesn ‚Äô t say this anymore . But there ‚Äô s one aspect of the scandal on which the president has been remarkably consistent :  Trump  has rejected the idea that Russia stole Democratic materials in the first place . Indeed   since the moment U . S . intelligence officials briefed the then - Republican candidate on this in 2016    Trump  rejected the claim as folly   going to far as to repeatedly mock American intelligence agencies . No matter how painfully obvious the facts were to everyone on the planet    Trump  refused to accept the most basic detail of the entire controversy . According to Sen . Lindsey Graham ( R - S . C .)  however   all of that has changed . Here ‚Äô s the exchange  he  had yesterday with NBC News ‚Äô Chuck Todd on ‚Äú Meet the Press .‚Äù GRAHAM : Well   the president does now finally believe that the Russians stole the emails from the DNC and hacked   and Clinton   and the Russians ‚Ä¶. The president does believe his intel agencies . Now   it ‚Äô s quite likely that  Trump  and Graham   who appear to now be rather close allies   have had private conversations in which the president has said things to the senator that he hasn ‚Äô t shared with the public . But if  Trump  told Graham he now believes Russians stole Democratic documents   it would represent a dramatic change of heart . As recently as mid - November ‚Äì not quite two months ago ‚Äì  Trump  told reporters that Vladimir Putin personally assured  him  that Russia didn ‚Äô t meddle in the American election . ‚Äú Every time  he  sees me  he  says   ‚Äò I didn ‚Äô t do that  ‚Äô and I really believe that when  he  tells me that    he  means it  ‚Äù the American president said in reference to his Russian counterpart . It was part of a lengthy pattern in which Trump refused to accept U . S . intelligence agencies ‚Äô findings . ‚Äú Nobody really knows for sure ‚Äù whether Russia intervened in the American elections   the president said in July ‚Äì after intelligence professionals told him they do know for sure . But according to Lindsey Graham   sometime between mid - November and early - January   Trump changed his mind   and if the senator is right   the shift is a pretty important development . Indeed   Graham ‚Äô s assertion raises some key follow - up questions for the White House : 1 . Can anyone from Trump World confirm whether Graham is correct ? If so   what finally convinced  Trump  to change his mind ? If  Trump  now believes Putin ‚Äô s government stole American materials in order to influence the outcome of American elections   what does the president intend to do to punish our foreign attackers ? If  Trump  now accepts the intelligence community ‚Äô s findings   does he have any regrets about insulting intelligence agencies for so long ? Should they expect a presidential apology ? Or is it possible Lindsey Graham is carrying water for his new pal   who ‚Äô ll soon make the senator appear foolish by saying the opposite of what the senator claimed yesterday ?\n",

       "      <td>Trump   Xi present united front despite differences BEIJING ‚Äî  President Donald Trump  sought to present a united front with Chinese President Xi Jinping following two days of meetings Thursday   despite lingering differences over trade and North Korea . On trade    Trump  criticized the ‚Äú very one - sided and unfair ‚Äù trade relationship between the U . S . and China but stopped short of castigating Xi by saying he doesn ‚Äô t blame the country for having taken advantage of the U . S .  Trump  said China ‚Äú must immediately address the unfair trade practices that drive ‚Äù what  he  said is a ‚Äú shockingly ‚Äù large trade deficit   along with barriers to market access   forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft . ‚Äú But I don ‚Äô t blame China  ‚Äù  he  said . ‚Äú After all   who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens ?‚Äù To applause    Trump  said : ‚Äú I give China great credit .‚Äù  His  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered a blunter assessment of China ‚Äô s trade surplus with the United States   which in October widened by 12 . 2 percent from a year earlier   to $ 26 . 6 billion . The total surplus with the United States for the first 10 months of the year was $ 223 billion . ___  Trump  cooperates with Chinese effort to control image BEIJING ‚Äî U . S .  President Donald Trump  was a cooperative partner for Beijing ‚Äô s sweeping efforts to control the message of  his  heavily choreographed visit to China . Trump and  his  Chinese counterpart   Xi Jinping   took no questions at an event Thursday billed as a news briefing   a reduction of already minimal press interaction during previous visits by American leaders . During a 2014 visit by then President Barack Obama   Xi took a symbolic single question from a reporter for a Chinese state newspaper . He brushed off an American reporter ‚Äô s question about whether Beijing might ease restrictions on journalist visas   saying vaguely that media outlets had to obey China ‚Äô s laws . Trump   who has called the media the ‚Äú enemy of the American people  ‚Äù also took no questions during an event at which Chinese companies signed contracts to buy American jetliners   soybeans and other goods . Trump ‚Äô s visit comes at a time when he faces uncomfortable questions at home about Russia and possible gun controls following deadly mass shootings . ___ North Korea   ever so cautiously   is going online PYONGYANG   North Korea ‚Äî Ever so cautiously   North Korea is going online . Doctors can consult via live   online video conferencing   and lectures at prestigious Kim Il Sung University are streamed to faraway factories and agricultural communes . People use online dictionaries and text each other on their smart phones . In the wallets of the privileged are ‚Äú Jonsong ‚Äù or ‚Äú Narae ‚Äù cards for e - shopping and online banking . Cash registers at major department stores are plugged into the web . It ‚Äô s just not the World Wide Web . This is all done on a tightly sealed intranet of the sort a medium - sized company might use for its employees . The free flow of information is anathema to authoritarian regimes   and with the possible exception of the African dictatorship of Eritrea   North Korea is still the least Internet - friendly country on Earth . Access to the global Internet for most is unimaginable . Hardly anyone has a personal computer or an email address that isn ‚Äô t shared   and the price for trying to get around the government ‚Äô s rules can be severe . But for Kim Jong Un   the country ‚Äô s first leader to come of age with the Internet   the idea of a more wired North Korea is also attractive . It comes with the potential for great benefits to the nation from information technology ‚Äî and for new forms of social and political control that promise to be more effective than anything his father and grandfather could have dreamed of . It also allows for the possibility of cyber - attacks on the West . ___ Pence   Abbott attend vigil for victims of church shooting SUTHERLAND SPRINGS   Texas ‚Äî Vice President Mike Pence joined Texas Gov . Greg Abbott at a memorial service for the victims of Sunday ‚Äô s massacre at a small - town Texas church . Pence told the crowd Wednesday evening that the shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs was the worst mass shooting at a church in American history and called the gunman ‚Äú deranged .‚Äù ‚Äú Whatever animated the evil that descended on that small church   of the attacker ‚Äô s desire was to silence their testimony of faith   they failed  ‚Äù the vice president added . Abbott began the service by praying ‚Äú for healing and for help .‚Äù The governor said that Texans come together at times of crisis and tragedy . ‚Äú It ‚Äô s what we do  ‚Äù Abbott said . People in the crowd responded ‚Äú amen .‚Äù ___ Las Vegas shooting victims still searching for their heroes LOS ANGELES ‚Äî As soon as Chris Gilman knew she would survive the gunshot wound she sustained in the Las Vegas massacre   she wanted to find the two strangers who saved her life ‚Äî a man and woman whose names she didn ‚Äô t even know . She found a Facebook page called ‚Äú Find My LV Hero ‚Äù and posted a plea . ‚Äú Looking for husband and wife who were by the VIP bleachers and helped me get out  ‚Äù wrote Gilman   of Bonney Lake   Washington . ‚Äú My wife gave the husband her shirt and the wife held it against my side to stop bleeding as they carried me through the VIP area out to the street .‚Äù Despite the scant details in Gilman ‚Äô s post   it worked . Three days later   Gilman connected with her rescuers   Alex and Wanda Valiente   off - duty Los Angeles County sheriff ‚Äô s deputies who were at the Oct . 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of a hotel   killing 58 people and wounding hundreds . The connection is one of about 25 made so far through the Facebook page . Nearly six weeks after the massacre   Ashton Zyer ‚Äô s social media creation continues to generate new searches for heroes who in some cases saved lives and in others simply provided what comfort they could . ___ IS militants evacuate last stronghold in Syria to government BEIRUT ‚Äî A Syrian war monitor says Islamic State militants have withdrawn from their last stronghold following a government offensive . The Britain - based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says government forces and allied troops   including Iraqi fighters   are combing Boukamal   a strategic town on the border with Iraq   on Thursday after IS militants withdrew . Syrian pro - government media say Syrian troops had clashed with remnants of IS militants in the town after they entered it late Wednesday . On Thursday   they declared the town totally free of the militants . The fall of Boukamal means remaining IS militants are currently holed up in small towns and villages along the border with Iraq and in the Syrian desert . ___ Democrats see wins as momentum for 2018 state elections Sweeping Democratic victories in Virginia and key gains in other 2017 state legislative races have lifted Democratic hopes of even bigger wins in next year ‚Äô s midterm elections   as they seek a greater voice in how political districts will be redrawn for the decade to come . Democrats won the governors ‚Äô offices in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday   erased a previously dominant Republican majority in the Virginia House of Delegates and won a special election that gave them control of the Washington state Senate . All told   Democrats flipped about two dozen state legislative seats around the country Tuesday and have now gained at least 30 seats previously held by Republicans since  President Donald Trump  won election last year   reversing several years of Republican momentum . ‚Äú In general   this is a rebuke of Republican governance of states  ‚Äù said Jessica Post   executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee . She added : ‚Äú The other thing it said is we can win all across the country .‚Äù The fight for control of legislative chambers matters not only for policies on health care   taxes and education   but also because the legislature in most states determines how future congressional and state legislative districts are drawn .

       "      <td>Trump   Xi present united front despite differences BEIJING ‚Äî  President Donald Trump  sought to present a united front with Chinese President Xi Jinping following two days of meetings Thursday   despite lingering differences over trade and North Korea . On trade    Trump  criticized the ‚Äú very one - sided and unfair ‚Äù trade relationship between the U . S . and China but stopped short of castigating Xi by saying he doesn ‚Äô t blame the country for having taken advantage of the U . S .  Trump  said China ‚Äú must immediately address the unfair trade practices that drive ‚Äù what  he  said is a ‚Äú shockingly ‚Äù large trade deficit   along with barriers to market access   forced technology transfers and intellectual property theft . ‚Äú But I don ‚Äô t blame China  ‚Äù  he  said . ‚Äú After all   who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for the benefit of its citizens ?‚Äù To applause    Trump  said : ‚Äú I give China great credit .‚Äù  His  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson offered a blunter assessment of China ‚Äô s trade surplus with the United States   which in October widened by 12 . 2 percent from a year earlier   to $ 26 . 6 billion . The total surplus with the United States for the first 10 months of the year was $ 223 billion . ___  Trump  cooperates with Chinese effort to control image BEIJING ‚Äî U . S .  President Donald Trump  was a cooperative partner for Beijing ‚Äô s sweeping efforts to control the message of  his  heavily choreographed visit to China . Trump and  his  Chinese counterpart   Xi Jinping   took no questions at an event Thursday billed as a news briefing   a reduction of already minimal press interaction during previous visits by American leaders . During a 2014 visit by then President Barack Obama   Xi took a symbolic single question from a reporter for a Chinese state newspaper . He brushed off an American reporter ‚Äô s question about whether Beijing might ease restrictions on journalist visas   saying vaguely that media outlets had to obey China ‚Äô s laws . Trump   who has called the media the ‚Äú enemy of the American people  ‚Äù also took no questions during an event at which Chinese companies signed contracts to buy American jetliners   soybeans and other goods . Trump ‚Äô s visit comes at a time when he faces uncomfortable questions at home about Russia and possible gun controls following deadly mass shootings . ___ North Korea   ever so cautiously   is going online PYONGYANG   North Korea ‚Äî Ever so cautiously   North Korea is going online . Doctors can consult via live   online video conferencing   and lectures at prestigious Kim Il Sung University are streamed to faraway factories and agricultural communes . People use online dictionaries and text each other on their smart phones . In the wallets of the privileged are ‚Äú Jonsong ‚Äù or ‚Äú Narae ‚Äù cards for e - shopping and online banking . Cash registers at major department stores are plugged into the web . It ‚Äô s just not the World Wide Web . This is all done on a tightly sealed intranet of the sort a medium - sized company might use for its employees . The free flow of information is anathema to authoritarian regimes   and with the possible exception of the African dictatorship of Eritrea   North Korea is still the least Internet - friendly country on Earth . Access to the global Internet for most is unimaginable . Hardly anyone has a personal computer or an email address that isn ‚Äô t shared   and the price for trying to get around the government ‚Äô s rules can be severe . But for Kim Jong Un   the country ‚Äô s first leader to come of age with the Internet   the idea of a more wired North Korea is also attractive . It comes with the potential for great benefits to the nation from information technology ‚Äî and for new forms of social and political control that promise to be more effective than anything his father and grandfather could have dreamed of . It also allows for the possibility of cyber - attacks on the West . ___ Pence   Abbott attend vigil for victims of church shooting SUTHERLAND SPRINGS   Texas ‚Äî Vice President Mike Pence joined Texas Gov . Greg Abbott at a memorial service for the victims of Sunday ‚Äô s massacre at a small - town Texas church . Pence told the crowd Wednesday evening that the shooting at the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs was the worst mass shooting at a church in American history and called the gunman ‚Äú deranged .‚Äù ‚Äú Whatever animated the evil that descended on that small church   of the attacker ‚Äô s desire was to silence their testimony of faith   they failed  ‚Äù the vice president added . Abbott began the service by praying ‚Äú for healing and for help .‚Äù The governor said that Texans come together at times of crisis and tragedy . ‚Äú It ‚Äô s what we do  ‚Äù Abbott said . People in the crowd responded ‚Äú amen .‚Äù ___ Las Vegas shooting victims still searching for their heroes LOS ANGELES ‚Äî As soon as Chris Gilman knew she would survive the gunshot wound she sustained in the Las Vegas massacre   she wanted to find the two strangers who saved her life ‚Äî a man and woman whose names she didn ‚Äô t even know . She found a Facebook page called ‚Äú Find My LV Hero ‚Äù and posted a plea . ‚Äú Looking for husband and wife who were by the VIP bleachers and helped me get out  ‚Äù wrote Gilman   of Bonney Lake   Washington . ‚Äú My wife gave the husband her shirt and the wife held it against my side to stop bleeding as they carried me through the VIP area out to the street .‚Äù Despite the scant details in Gilman ‚Äô s post   it worked . Three days later   Gilman connected with her rescuers   Alex and Wanda Valiente   off - duty Los Angeles County sheriff ‚Äô s deputies who were at the Oct . 1 concert where a gunman opened fire from the 32nd floor of a hotel   killing 58 people and wounding hundreds . The connection is one of about 25 made so far through the Facebook page . Nearly six weeks after the massacre   Ashton Zyer ‚Äô s social media creation continues to generate new searches for heroes who in some cases saved lives and in others simply provided what comfort they could . ___ IS militants evacuate last stronghold in Syria to government BEIRUT ‚Äî A Syrian war monitor says Islamic State militants have withdrawn from their last stronghold following a government offensive . The Britain - based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says government forces and allied troops   including Iraqi fighters   are combing Boukamal   a strategic town on the border with Iraq   on Thursday after IS militants withdrew . Syrian pro - government media say Syrian troops had clashed with remnants of IS militants in the town after they entered it late Wednesday . On Thursday   they declared the town totally free of the militants . The fall of Boukamal means remaining IS militants are currently holed up in small towns and villages along the border with Iraq and in the Syrian desert . ___ Democrats see wins as momentum for 2018 state elections Sweeping Democratic victories in Virginia and key gains in other 2017 state legislative races have lifted Democratic hopes of even bigger wins in next year ‚Äô s midterm elections   as they seek a greater voice in how political districts will be redrawn for the decade to come . Democrats won the governors ‚Äô offices in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday   erased a previously dominant Republican majority in the Virginia House of Delegates and won a special election that gave them control of the Washington state Senate . All told   Democrats flipped about two dozen state legislative seats around the country Tuesday and have now gained at least 30 seats previously held by Republicans since  President Donald Trump  won election last year   reversing several years of Republican momentum . ‚Äú In general   this is a rebuke of Republican governance of states  ‚Äù said Jessica Post   executive director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee . She added : ‚Äú The other thing it said is we can win all across the country .‚Äù The fight for control of legislative chambers matters not only for policies on health care   taxes and education   but also because the legislature in most states determines how future congressional and state legislative districts are drawn . The next round of redistricting will take place after the 2020 Census   and both parties are focused on controlling as many states as possible by then . ___ Pomp and flattery : Asia rolls out the red carpets for Trump BEIJING ‚Äî Honor guards marching in unison in colorful uniforms . Elaborate state dinners with celebrity guests . Gaggles of children   jumping and screaming along with endless praise . The first half of President Donald Trump ‚Äô s whirlwind tour to Asia has been an exercise in the art of flattery   as world leaders woo the man who was introduced at the South Korean National Assembly as the ‚Äú leader of the world .‚Äù ‚Äú They are not ignorant that this is a president who is particularly responsive to flattery  ‚Äù said Lindsey Ford of the Asia Society Policy Institute in Washington   who said the Chinese   in particular   would ‚Äú absolutely go over the top ‚Äù trying to stroke the president ‚Äô s ego .

I visited with a <font color = red>lot</font> of them . But we ‚Äô ll turn our grief into <font color = red>action</font> .‚Äù While the media campaign from the young survivors of the Parkland shooting has kept up the pressure on lawmakers to act   many Republicans are still reluctant to push significant changes to gun policy and challenge the NRA   which has five million members ‚Äî the majority of whom <font color = red>live</font> in conservative districts . In a <font color = red>room</font> with <font color = red>several</font> <font color = red>Republican</font> governors    Trump  said <font color = red>Monday</font> not to <font color = red>worry</font> about the <font color = red>influential</font> <font color = red>group</font> . \" You guys ‚Äî half of you are so afraid of the NRA  ‚Äù  he  said . ‚Äú There ' s nothing to be afraid of . And you know what   if they ' re not with you   we have to fight them every once in a while . That ' s OK .\" Despite Trump ‚Äô s lobbying and <font color = red>focus</font>   several Republicans who are strong advocates of the Second Amendment aren ‚Äô t convinced gun control measures will curb mass shootings . Some <font color = red>Republicans</font>   like <font color = red>Arizona</font> <font color = red>Sen</font> . Jeff Flake   who is not running for reelection   are more open to gun control reforms   including raising the age for purchasing some types of guns to 21 . ‚Äú <font color = red>This</font> shooting was <font color = red>different</font>  ‚Äù Flake told reporters   arguing that it would be hard for Republicans to not bring legislation up for a vote . ‚Äú It was amazing to me how quickly it died down after Las Vegas   but this one   with high school kids who have been very articulate in their   you know   in their explanation of what ' s needed and social media and everything else . We seem to have crossed the Rubicon here .\" Florida Rep . Mario D√≠az - Balart also took a more open position . ‚Äú I ' m willing to look at anything to keep the American people safe   but I also need to make sure that we protect individual liberties  \" he told reporters Monday . Rep . Mark Meadows   chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus   said his group plans to discuss various gun control measures   but some   such as raising the legal age of purchasing some firearms   will not be supported by the majority of the Republican party . Another measure being discussed is the so - called Fix NICS bill   which would strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System . That measure was passed by the House in December   but only after being tied to rules that would allow anyone with a concealed - carry permit to carry concealed weapons across state lines . That made the bill a nonstarter in the Senate . Meadows said at the time Speaker Paul Ryan told the Freedom Caucus there would be no other votes on Fix NICS . Now it is being floated again   but Meadows says the Freedom Caucus has objections over due process fears . Meadows said the legislation as written would allow for guns to be taken away from people who do not have proper channels to defend their mental state . The  Trump  administration   for all of the president ‚Äô s calls to action   has not moved to rally Republicans around any specific proposals   and is yet to provide any language on exactly what they would like Congress to support .  Trump  has said several times  he  ‚Äô d like to strengthen background checks   but the president and  his  aides have declined to say if they support universal background checks   which failed to garner enough votes in Congress in the wake of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting . And on raising the age requirements   a measure that the NRA does not support   White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday   ‚Äú it would be premature for us to weigh in . But   as I said   the president is still supportive of the concept .‚Äù Reluctant Republicans could be more willing to get behind the president once he officially backs specific proposals   said South Carolina Sen . Lindsey Graham . ‚Äú Anything the president gets behind   because he ' s a Republican president   is a game changer  ‚Äù Graham told reporters Monday . ‚Äú So if he wants to raise the age to 21   I ' m not so sure that ' s a good idea   but if he got behind it   then you ' re in the ball game .\" Without backing from Republicans in Congress   there is little that the administration can do to curb gun violence . Even on banning bump stocks ‚Äî the one measure that the president has said he can do through the Department of Justice ‚Äî it ‚Äô s unclear if the department will have the authority to enforce such a ban   and there are already concerns about the legal battles it could lead to . And Trump ‚Äô s oft mentioned idea to arm thousands of teachers or train them to conceal and carry has proven to be divisive   even among congressional Republicans . \" I think arming educators is a really bad idea  \" Maine GOP Sen . Susan Collins told reporters Monday . Because they ' re trained to teach   not to be security guards . They already have a lot on their plate   and I think it ' s a terrible idea .\" Montana Sen . Steve Daines   meanwhile   said he does support arming schools   and opposes most of the other policies his colleagues or the president have raised . He dismissed proposals such as raising the legal age limit to buy certain types of weapons as ‚Äú feel - good measures that are not going to solve the problem .‚Äù He pointed to the US Capitol as a potential model for school safety . ‚Äú Why have we not seen an active shooting in the Capitol ? You know why   because we have armed guards out front  ‚Äù Daines said . Meadows also said he is open to the idea of protecting schools by arming some teachers . ‚Äú It happens in other areas . Churches generally have concealed - carry security guards each and every Sunday . Certainly in Israel the synagogues do  ‚Äù he said . Several other Republicans simply avoided taking hard stances on any of the president ‚Äô s ideas on gun control . Louisiana Sen . Bill Cassidy said he is ‚Äú willing to consider ‚Äù the proposal to arm teachers in schools   and Alabama Sen . Richard Shelby urged caution on that particular idea   but he did not come out against it .

I visited with a <font color = blue>lots</font> of them . But we ‚Äô ll turn our grief into <font color = blue>pursuits</font> .‚Äù While the media campaign from the young survivors of the Parkland shooting has kept up the pressure on lawmakers to act   many Republicans are still reluctant to push significant changes to gun policy and challenge the NRA   which has five million members ‚Äî the majority of whom <font color = blue>livelihood</font> in conservative districts . In a <font color = blue>housing</font> with <font color = blue>differentiated</font> <font color = blue>Senators</font> governors    Trump  said <font color = blue>Yesterday</font> not to <font color = blue>fearing</font> about the <font color = blue>powerful</font> <font color = blue>teaming</font> . \" You guys ‚Äî half of you are so afraid of the NRA  ‚Äù  he  said . ‚Äú There ' s nothing to be afraid of . And you know what   if they ' re not with you   we have to fight them every once in a while . That ' s OK .\" Despite Trump ‚Äô s lobbying and <font color = blue>centre</font>   several Republicans who are strong advocates of the Second Amendment aren ‚Äô t convinced gun control measures will curb mass shootings . Some <font color = blue>Mccain</font>   like <font color = blue>Glendale</font> <font color = blue>Enact</font> . Jeff Flake   who is not running for reelection   are more open to gun control reforms   including raising the age for purchasing some types of guns to 21 . ‚Äú <font color = blue>These</font> shooting was <font color = blue>variable</font>  ‚Äù Flake told reporters   arguing that it would be hard for Republicans to not bring legislation up for a vote . ‚Äú It was amazing to me how quickly it died down after Las Vegas   but this one   with high school kids who have been very articulate in their   you know   in their explanation of what ' s needed and social media and everything else . We seem to have crossed the Rubicon here .\" Florida Rep . Mario D√≠az - Balart also took a more open position . ‚Äú I ' m willing to look at anything to keep the American people safe   but I also need to make sure that we protect individual liberties  \" he told reporters Monday . Rep . Mark Meadows   chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus   said his group plans to discuss various gun control measures   but some   such as raising the legal age of purchasing some firearms   will not be supported by the majority of the Republican party . Another measure being discussed is the so - called Fix NICS bill   which would strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System . That measure was passed by the House in December   but only after being tied to rules that would allow anyone with a concealed - carry permit to carry concealed weapons across state lines . That made the bill a nonstarter in the Senate . Meadows said at the time Speaker Paul Ryan told the Freedom Caucus there would be no other votes on Fix NICS . Now it is being floated again   but Meadows says the Freedom Caucus has objections over due process fears . Meadows said the legislation as written would allow for guns to be taken away from people who do not have proper channels to defend their mental state . The  Trump  administration   for all of the president ‚Äô s calls to action   has not moved to rally Republicans around any specific proposals   and is yet to provide any language on exactly what they would like Congress to support .  Trump  has said several times  he  ‚Äô d like to strengthen background checks   but the president and  his  aides have declined to say if they support universal background checks   which failed to garner enough votes in Congress in the wake of the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting . And on raising the age requirements   a measure that the NRA does not support   White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday   ‚Äú it would be premature for us to weigh in . But   as I said   the president is still supportive of the concept .‚Äù Reluctant Republicans could be more willing to get behind the president once he officially backs specific proposals   said South Carolina Sen . Lindsey Graham . ‚Äú Anything the president gets behind   because he ' s a Republican president   is a game changer  ‚Äù Graham told reporters Monday . ‚Äú So if he wants to raise the age to 21   I ' m not so sure that ' s a good idea   but if he got behind it   then you ' re in the ball game .\" Without backing from Republicans in Congress   there is little that the administration can do to curb gun violence . Even on banning bump stocks ‚Äî the one measure that the president has said he can do through the Department of Justice ‚Äî it ‚Äô s unclear if the department will have the authority to enforce such a ban   and there are already concerns about the legal battles it could lead to . And Trump ‚Äô s oft mentioned idea to arm thousands of teachers or train them to conceal and carry has proven to be divisive   even among congressional Republicans . \" I think arming educators is a really bad idea  \" Maine GOP Sen . Susan Collins told reporters Monday . Because they ' re trained to teach   not to be security guards . They already have a lot on their plate   and I think it ' s a terrible idea .\" Montana Sen . Steve Daines   meanwhile   said he does support arming schools   and opposes most of the other policies his colleagues or the president have raised . He dismissed proposals such as raising the legal age limit to buy certain types of weapons as ‚Äú feel - good measures that are not going to solve the problem .‚Äù He pointed to the US Capitol as a potential model for school safety . ‚Äú Why have we not seen an active shooting in the Capitol ? You know why   because we have armed guards out front  ‚Äù Daines said . Meadows also said he is open to the idea of protecting schools by arming some teachers . ‚Äú It happens in other areas . Churches generally have concealed - carry security guards each and every Sunday . Certainly in Israel the synagogues do  ‚Äù he said . Several other Republicans simply avoided taking hard stances on any of the president ‚Äô s ideas on gun control . Louisiana Sen . Bill Cassidy said he is ‚Äú willing to consider ‚Äù the proposal to arm teachers in schools   and Alabama Sen . Richard Shelby urged caution on that particular idea   but he did not come out against it . A Parkland student and one of the young organizers of the # NeverAgain movement for gun control that has come out of the shooting met with Democrats Monday   and tweeted that the ‚Äú uproar ‚Äù over guns is now ‚Äú undeniable .‚Äù</td>\n",
